            <p>Heyo people my Name is Yachi. Well of cause its not my real name, I just use it as my internet name.
                I am 16 years old, doing a apprenticeship as an electrical engineer and trying to improve my programming
                skills as a hooby. In my free time I use to go skating or meet friends of mine. I live in Austria and sprak
                German and English fluently. Well I guess there is no
                 more interresting to say about me.

        <div class="normal-text">
            <p>My main programming language is Python, but I also know a bit of javascript for 
                webdeveloping and of cause HTML and CSS. Oh yeah I know that HTML and CSS are no 
                programming languages, don't worry. With python I do projects in cyber security and
                discord bots mainly and a few other things. I also know a bit of C for hardware programming.
